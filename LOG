Implemented SVD technique and cross validation wrapper.

affinities-100sr-shuffled.dat 
	Contains 100000 pairs of (users, subreddits), with top 100 popular subreddits.
	Data is shuffled to prevent bias during cross validation.

53% accuracy with 10-fold cross validation, with euclidean distance as the metric,
and threshold of 1.03. Affinities are in the range 0.0 to 1.0, zeroAffinityValue = 0.5.

// TODO Test with affinity scale [-1.0, 1.0], vary threshold.
// TODO Dig up the paper from downloads.
